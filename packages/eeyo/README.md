# Eeyo.Re -> Error handling tools for Reason ML

Yes, just like that Eeyore: always being depressing and whining about errors.
This project adds some error handling boilerplate around Belt.Result to contain better information than
just strings.

## TODO

- ppx for scanning, and gathering lists of custom errors and generating a set of project level variants
- Derive converters between projects that use Eeyo.
